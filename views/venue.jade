            | In Montevideo taxis are safe to use. The meter next to the
            | driver should be at zero when you start your journey. When
            | you reach your destination the number on the meter tallies
            | with a number on the pricing card you will be shown. Next to
            | the number is the actual cost in Uruguayan Pesos, drivers may
            | occasionally accept dollars, argentinian pesos or reais. The
            | pricing card should always be available for you to check prices.

            | Credit cards are widely accepted in most hotels, restaurants
            | and shops. ATMs are also available and are not in the street.
            | Even though Montevideo is quite safe for tourists, street crime
            | like bag snatching and pick-pocketing occurs, please pay
            | particular attention to your belongings. Try to keep away from
            | isolated or poorly lit areas at night and avoid walking downtown
            | or in the port area alone.
