          h3 The perks of being a Speaker at JSConf UY
          p
            | If you get selected as a speaker at JSConf UY, here's what you get:
            ul
              li <b>We cover your stay in Montevideo </b> in a nice hotel (including free Wifi) for the duration of the conference, two nights before and one after.
                | If you would like to extend your stay, just let us know so we can make the necessary arrangements. You will have to cover for extra nights, though. 
                | If your employer can cover your travel and hotel expenses, we will happy to list them as an awesome company sponsor. The money we save will be invested in making a better conference.
              li <b>Travel expeses to Montevideo covered.</b> This usually means we pay plane/ferry fees. We are happy to assist you by booking your itinerary.
              li <b>Speaker dinner.</b> All speakers are invited to taste uruguayan food at a dinner the evening before the event.
              li <b>A JSConf UY t-shirt

          h3 The Selection Process
          p
            | Some aspects about how the talks will be chosen:
            ul
              li Anonymize submissions, so we're not biased when considering the submitter.
              li Two rounds of voting:
              li The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 5.
              li The submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale: “fair”, “good”, “MUST HAVE”.
              li De-anonymize so we can finally consider details regarding the speaker. Based on our budget, we might opt for a local or at least closer speaker (read: cheaper to transport).
            p
            | We expect many excellent submissions. This process will help us play nice and select the right speakers.

          h3 Guidelines for proposals
          p
            | Submit your proposal by <b>Jan 17th 2014, 23:59:59 UYT(GMT-3).</b>
          p
            | Talks may be in <b>English or Spanish</b>. Please choose the language you feel more comfortable with.
          p
            | <b>Your talk may take 30 minutes</b> (contact us if you need to talk longer). There is no additional Q&A section. There will be plenty of time for further discussion during breaks. We will enforce the timely end of a talks, therefore we strongly recommend timing your presentation in advance.
          p
            | <b>Make a nice submission,</b> and make sure we notice that you care about it. Avoid typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase text. Be concise: If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point across, it is likely you won’t make it in 30 minutes. Please make our reading proposals straightforward.
          p
            | <b>Original Topics.</b> We favor original content. If you want to discuss a topic that you have talked about elsewhere then try to add a twist, new research, deeper development or something unique. Please bear in mind that we want this conference to be enjoyable for everyone, therefore we expect you to adhere to the JSConf code of conduct. And of course, if your talk is plain awesome as-is,  just go for it!
