          h3 The perks of being a Speaker at JSConf UY
          p
            | If you get selected as a speaker at JSConf UY, here's what you get:
            ul
              li <b>We cover your stay in Montevideo </b> in a nice hotel (including free Wifi) for the days of the conference two nights before and one after. If you want to stay longer, we can arrange things, just let us know. You will have to cover extra nights, though. If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we are happy to list them as an awesome company sponsor. The money we save will be used to make a better conference.
              li <b>Travel to Montevideo covered.</b> This usually means we pay for your plane/ferry. We are happy to assist with booking your itinerary.
              li <b>Speakers' dinner.</b> All speakers are invited to taste uruguayan food at a dinner the evening before the event.
              li <b>A JSConf UY t-shirt
          p
            Let us know if you need help with anything that is not listed here, we'll be more than happy to help.

          h3 The Selection Process
          p
            | Some aspects about how we choose the talks:
            ul
              li Anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the submitting person.
              li Two rounds of voting:
              li The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 5.
              li The submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale: “fair”, “good”, “MUST HAVE”.
              li De-anonymize so we can finally bias against speaker details. Based on our budget, we might opt for a local or at least closer-by (read: cheaper to transport) speaker.
            p
            | We expect many excellent submissions for the speaking slots. This process helps us to select the right ones and play nice.

          h3 Guidelines for proposals
          p
            | Submit your proposal by <b>Jan 17th 2014, 23:59:59 UYT(GMT-3).</b>
          p
            | Talks may be in <b>English or Spanish</b>. Please choose the language you feel more comfortable with.
          p
            | <b>Your talk may take 30 minutes</b> (contact us if you need to talk longer). There is no additional Q&A section. There will be plenty of time during the breaks for further discussion of topics. We will enforce the end of a talk rigorously, therefore we strongly recommend timing your presentation in advance.
          p
            | <b>Make a nice submission,</b> and make sure we see you care about it. Avoid typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase text. Be concise: If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, it is likely you won’t make it in 30 minutes. Please make our reading of your proposal straightforward.
          p
            | <b>Original Topics.</b> We favour original content. If you want to discuss a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, or new research, or development, something unique. Please bear in mind that we want this conference to be enjoyable for everyone, therefore we expect you to adhere to the JSConf code of conduct. And of course, if your talk is plain awesome as-is,  just go for it!
